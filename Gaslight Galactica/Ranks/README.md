# Introduction to ranks

Imposter and crewmate ranks are a new feature in Gaslight Galactica that isn't in Among Us (As of Friday, December 11th 2020) Ranks help prevent people from disconnecting due to not getting imposter or crewmate, as it requires an older account, and adds consequence for leaving early too often. If your battery or Internet dies, unfortunately, it is just too bad

Ranks are not required for server creation, but ranks can only be lost on rank-enabled servers. This feature helps improve the quality of gameplay.
